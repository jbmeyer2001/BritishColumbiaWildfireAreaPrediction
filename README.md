# BritishColumbiaWildfireAreaPrediction
The purpose of this project was (and is) to get more familiar with machine learning and working with real-world data (not necessarily nicely formed datasets that might be given as part of an assignment). 
Using the data that I was able to find, both governmental sources, one being a record of wildfires in British Columbia and the other being yearly weather data from within different fire zones on BC, I
tried to create a machine learning model to predict the area of wildfires in a given fire zone on a certain month.
